Welcome!


This site is letting me collect my ideas about Python and Design Patterns all in one place.
My hope is that these pages make the patterns more discoverable — easier to find in web searches, and easier to read — than when they were scattered across the videos and slides of my Python conference talks.
The weight of other obligations makes my progress intermittent. To check for new material, simply visit the commit history of this site’s project repository on GitHub, where you can also select “Watch” to get updates.ß
